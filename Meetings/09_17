Hello Everybody,

Let's begin with a standup. This is cool because it shows team-wide knowledge like do the Programmers know as a whole what they're doing next, who is blocked, what have been doing or need.

Then, let's split into teams:
-Art, Audio, and Design will get together to talk about the monster ideas. Decide on a first one that is interesting mechanically and offers a way to test our systems of signs, item collection, crafting, and using the items to vanquish the monster or escape death.
-Programmers should get together to learn more unity and get concrete programming tasks

After that, we'll regroup to talk about the first monster and environment.

Then, breakout again so that designers can download unity and split into deciding signs / weaknesses / strengths and learn environmental design in engine.
